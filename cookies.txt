	Session Management or State Management Objects
	
	To maintain the identity of the application
	PHP provides two objects, they are:
	Cookie
	Session.
	
	Why shuold we use cookie and session?
	
	To know this, We have know about the Protocols
	
	Protocol: A protocol is a set of rules and
	regulations to transfer the data between the networks
	
	Generally protocols are divided into Two types:
	1. Stateless Protocols
	2. Statefull Protocols
	
	Stateless Protocols:
	===================
	The protocols which does not remember the previous
	requests data are said to be stateless protocols.
	
	Examples: http, https
	
	Statefull Protocols:
	===================
	The protocols which can remember the previous
	requests data are said to be statefull protocols.
	
	Examples: ftp, TCP/IP etc..
	
	
	Here, we can always see stateless protocols in web
	networks to transfer the data.
	
	we know, if we use stateless protocols we can not
	get the previous request and response data.
	
	=========================
	TO bring previous request and response data to the
	current page we can use either COOKIE or SESSION
	=========================
	
	Cookie:
	========
	A Cookie a small amount of data which always stores
	inside a Browser.
	
	Creating a cookie:
	===================
	BY using setcookie() method we can create cookies
	
	setcookie("cookie name","cookie value");
	
	setcookie("state","TS");
	setcookie("city","Hyd");
	
	Cookies are browser independent means, the cookies
	which are created in one browser can not access
	in other browsers
	
	Cookies are divided into two types, they are:
	in-memory cookies
	Persistent cookies
	
	in-memory cookies:
	==================
	The cookies which are created with out expiry time
	are said to be in-memory cookies
	
	ex: setcookie("number1",10);
	
	In-memory cookies are destroyed automatically, when
	we close the browser
	
	Persistent cookies:
	==================
	The cookies which are created with expiry time
	are said to be persistent cookies
	
	ex: setcookie("number1",10,time()+60*60*24);//1day
		setcookie("number1",10,time()+2*60);//2mins
	
	Persistent cookies are destroyed automatically, 
	when the expiry time is completed.
	
	How to destroy persistent cookie
	
		(or)
		
	How to destroy cookie
	========================
	
	By setting negative time for the cookie
	
	setcookie("number1",10,time()-60*60*24);
	
	
	
	How read Cookie values:
	=======================
	by using $_COOKIE[] super global Variable
	
	$_COOKIE['number1'];
	$_COOKIE['city'];
	$_COOKIE['state'];
